## Branch Naming Conventions for Algorithm Challenge Solutions

To maintain an organized repository and avoid conflicts, please follow these branch naming conventions when submitting your solutions for the algorithm challenges:

### Branch Naming Format

Use the following format for naming your branches:
```
solution/<your-username>/<challenge-name>
```

### Examples

1. If your GitHub username is `johnDoe` and you are submitting a solution for the `binary-search` challenge, your branch name should be:
   ```
   solution/johnDoe/binary-search
   ```

2. If your GitHub username is `janeSmith` and you are submitting a solution for the `merge-sort` challenge, your branch name should be:
   ```
   solution/janeSmith/merge-sort
   ```

### Steps to Create and Submit Your Solution Branch

1. **Pull the Latest Changes from the Main Branch**:
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Create a New Branch for Your Solution**:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b solution/<your-username>/<challenge-name>
   ```

3. **Implement Your Solution**:
   - Add your solution files and make necessary changes.
   - Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
     ```sh
     git add .
     git commit -m "Add solution for <challenge-name> by <your-username>"
     ```

4. **Push Your Solution Branch to the Remote Repository**:
   ```sh
   git push origin solution/<your-username>/<challenge-name>
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to the repository on GitHub.
   - Click on **Pull requests**.
   - Click on **New pull request**.
   - Select `main` as the base branch and your solution branch as the compare branch.
   - Provide a clear description of your solution in the pull request.
   - Submit the pull request for review.

### Additional Guidelines

- **One Solution per Branch**: Each branch should contain the solution for one specific algorithm challenge.
- **Clear Commit Messages**: Use clear and descriptive commit messages to explain the changes made in your solution.
- **Code Reviews**: Be prepared for code reviews and incorporate feedback to improve your solution.

By following these conventions, we can ensure a smooth and efficient collaboration process. Thank you for your contributions!
